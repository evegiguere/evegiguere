- 👋 Hi, I’m @evegiguere
- 👀 I’m interested in travel, nature (hiking, birdwatching in particular), cooking, running, swimming... so many things, but life is too short!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to explore and visualize data... among other things... When you stop learning you die (says my grandma still alive at over 95).
- 💞️ I’m not yet looking to collaborate because I don't think I am there yet... but maybe it is just because I have not thought this through.
- 📫 How to reach me - send me a message here: https://www.linkedin.com/in/eve-gigu%C3%A8re-b5082883/.
